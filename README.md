This script helps you "view" the contents of a ZIP file hosted on the internet.

Note: It is not a replacement for antivirus software, so make sure your download link is safe before proceeding.

The tool is specifically designed to handle large ZIP files and provides an interactive way to explore and generate reports about their contents.

It allows you to navigate through the files interactively.


To use this script:

or Generate a Comprehensive Report:
